    "STYLE_PROMPT_EFFECT = \"\"\"You are a helpful assistant that always closely follows instructions. Your overall task is to generate feedback which a user gives to a LLM to improve its responses. The user is asking the LLM for responses and has found something they would like the LLM to improve upon. This means the feedback should be something a LLM would not already follow well. For example, feedback to \"write work emails more politely\" is NOT GOOD because LLMs already generate very polite work emails. The feedback should target something the LLM can improve on. Assume this LLM only takes text as input and outputs only text.\n",
